# Java Practice Codes  

This repository contains my practice codes in Java, organized by topics:  
- **Basic Calculations** – Simple math operations like age calculation, average marks, and distance conversions.  
- **Logical Operations** – Programs that involve logical calculations using conditions and loops.  
- **User Input** – Codes that take user input for dynamic calculations.  
- **Advanced Calculations** – Complex calculations like volume or percentage.  

## 📚 About This Repository  
- This repository helps me track my learning progress as a Computer Science student.
